infrastructure
==============

Creates the core constructs starting with the VPC. This project is a prerequisite for all other projects.

# Prerequisites

1. **Jump Box SSH Key Pair:** Via the EC2 console, create or import an SSH key pair named `jump-box`. If an alternate name is used, specify the name via the [`JumpBoxKeyName`](#jump-box-key-name) parameter. This SSH key is only used to connect to the `jump-box` instance from the open Internet so distribute it carefully.

    **Note:** For convenience the following `$HOME/.ssh/config` file can be used to manage the jump box SSH key (assumes the `jump-box` private key is stored in `$HOME/.ssh/id_rsa_jump_box` with [`DNSZone`](#dns-zone) and [`FullyQualifiedExternalParentDNSZone`](#fully-qualified-external-parent-dns-zone) set to `prod` and `example.com` respectively):
    ```
    Host jb jump-box jump-box.prod.example.com
      HostName jump-box.prod.example.com
      User ubuntu
      IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa_jump_box
      ForwardAgent yes
    ```

2. **Internal SSH Key Pair:** Via the EC2 console, create or import an SSH key pair named `internal`. If an alternate name is used, specify the name via the [`InternalKeyName`](#internal-key-name) parameter. This SSH key is used to connect to all infrastructure instances except the `jump-box` instance.

    **Note:** Prior to `ssh`ing to the jump box, the internal key must be added to the SSH key forwarding agent using the following command (assumes the `internal` private key is stored in `$HOME/.ssh/id_rsa_internal`):
    ```bash
    ssh-add $HOME/.ssh/id_rsa_internal
    ```

3. **DNS Hosted Zone (optional):** Create a publicly accessible DNS hosted zone via the Route 53 console. The infrastructure project only uses this zone to create a DNS `A` record pointing to the `jump-box` instance (i.e.: `jump-box.prod.example.com` if [`DNSZone`](#dns-zone) is set to `prod` and [`FullyQualifiedExternalParentDNSZone`](#fully-qualified-external-parent-dns-zone) is set to `example.com`).

4. **Virtual Private Network (optional):** Deploy either an [AWS-compatible hardware or software VPN](https://aws.amazon.com/vpc/faqs/#C9). By doing so, the site of the VPN will have direct connectivity to your VPC without having to use the jump box.

## Full Stack

The full stack isn't really a stack but a set of convenience shell scripts for creating and deleting the [VPC](#vpc), [public infrastructure](#public-infrastructure), and [private infrastructure](#private-infrastructure) stacks in the proper order. Note that create script outputs several sets of environment variables that all need to be exported for use in other stacks. The create script itself handles passing the environment variables from one sub-script to another.

 Delete Script | [`scripts/delete-full-stack.sh`](scripts/delete-full-stack.sh)

<!---
DNS Notes (something here may be useful when resurrecting the DNS functionality)
1. Create VPC stack [`vpc.yml`](./vpc.yml) (S3 URL [here](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aws-musings-us-east-1/infrastructure/vpc.yml).

2. Create VPN stack [`vpn.yml`](./vpn.yml) (optional, S3 URL [here](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aws-musings-us-east-1/infrastructure/vpn.yml).

3. Create Public Infrastructure stack [`public-infrastructure.yml`](./public-infrastructure.yml) (S3 URL [here](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aws-musings-us-east-1/infrastructure/public-infrastructure.yml).

  NOTE: IF THE STACK IN STEP 3 IS BURNED DOWN, THE STACK IN STEP 1 WILL BE IN A BAD STATE.
  RESET THE VPC'S DHCP OPTIONS BEFORE ATTEMPTING TO REBUILD THE STACK IN STEP 3!!!!!!!!!!!

  Burning down the step 3 stack sets the DHCP options to 'default' which probably doesn't
  really exist. Set the DHCP options back to the DHCP options created by AWS (one with
  domain-name-servers = AmazonProvidedDNS).

4. Connect to DNS instance and execute the following:

  ```bash
  sudo chown named:named /var/log/named
  ```

  TODO: CF init should be able to resolve the chown issue eventually.

5. Restarting is only necessary to make the previous change take effect.

  ```bash
  sudo /etc/init.d/named restart
  ```

6. Create Private Infrastructure stack [`private-infrastructure.yml`](./private-infrastructure.yml) (S3 URL [here](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aws-musings-us-east-1/infrastructure/private-infrastructure.yml).
