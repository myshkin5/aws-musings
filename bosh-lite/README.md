bosh-lite
=========

The bosh-lite sub-project contains two scripts: one for creating the bosh-lite infrastructure that is typically just run once and another to create a bosh-lite instance which can be run repeatedly on top of the bosh-lite infrastructure.

# Prerequisites

Outputs from the [infrastructure sub-project](../infrastructure) are required inputs for bosh-lite creation.

# Stacks

## bosh-lite-infrastructure

Creates a public subnet, a private subnet and security groups all used by bosh-lite instances and ELBs.

### Post Creation Steps

After a bosh-lite instance has been created, the Cloud Foundry router is still not accessible to the outside world. Eventually the router should be automatically available via `iptables` configuration but until then, the following commands should be executed from a `root` terminal session:

```bash
IP_ADDR=$(ifconfig eth0 | grep "inet addr" | cut -d : -f 2 | cut -d \  -f 1)
ssh -L $IP_ADDR:443:10.244.0.34:443 localhost
```
